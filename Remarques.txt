//express-session module presentation:
	Note Session data is not saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID. Session data is stored server-side.

	Note Since version 1.5.0, the cookie-parser middleware no longer needs to be used for this module to work. This module now directly reads and writes cookies on req/res. Using cookie-parser may result in issues if the secret is not the same between this module and cookie-parser.

	Warning The default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is purposely not designed for a production environment. It will leak memory under most conditions, does not scale past a single process, and is meant for debugging and developing.
	
// When lunching the node app in the server, all middleware in used are loaded, and wait to be executed.
